# 🗑️ Assistant Deletion Feature - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview
When you delete an assistant in the Admin Portal, the system now **completely removes**:
1. ✅ **Assistant record** from Firestore `assistants` collection
2. ✅ **User profile** from Firestore `users` collection  
3. ✅ **Authentication account** from Firebase Authentication (optional, requires Firebase Admin SDK)

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **Files Modified/Created:**

1. **API Route** - `src/app/api/assistant/delete-auth/route.ts`
   - Handles deletion of user from Firebase Authentication
   - Uses Firebase Admin SDK (server-side)
   - Gracefully handles missing credentials

2. **Hook Updated** - `src/lib/hooks/useAssistants.ts`
   - Updated `deleteAssistant()` function
   - Now deletes in proper order:
     - User document
     - Authentication account
     - Assistant document

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Options)

### **Option 1: Basic Setup (Firestore Only)**
✅ **Already Working!** No additional setup needed.

- Deletes assistant from Firestore
- Deletes user profile from Firestore
- ⚠️ Auth account remains (but user can't login without Firestore profile)

**Status:** Ready to use immediately

---

### **Option 2: Complete Setup (with Firebase Auth Deletion)**
✅ Recommended for production

- Deletes assistant from Firestore
- Deletes user profile from Firestore
- ✅ Deletes auth account from Firebase Authentication

**Requires:**
1. Install Firebase Admin SDK
2. Get service account credentials
3. Add credentials to environment variables

---

## 📦 Complete Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Firebase Admin SDK

```bash
npm install firebase-admin
# or
pnpm add firebase-admin
```

---

### Step 2: Get Firebase Service Account Credentials

#### **Method A: Firebase Console (Recommended)**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click **⚙️ Settings** (gear icon) → **Project Settings**
4. Go to **Service Accounts** tab
5. Click **"Generate New Private Key"**
6. Save the JSON file securely
7. ⚠️ **Important:** Never commit this file to git!

#### **Method B: Extract from JSON file**

Open the downloaded JSON file and extract these values:
```json
{
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

---

### Step 3: Add Credentials to Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Firebase Admin SDK Credentials (for deleting auth users)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour\nPrivate\nKey\nHere\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

**Important Notes:**
- Keep the private key in quotes
- Preserve all `\n` characters (they represent line breaks)
- The key should start with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n`
- The key should end with `\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n`

---

### Step 4: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

---

## ✅ Testing the Setup

### Test 1: Basic Deletion (Firestore Only)

1. Navigate to **Admin → Assistants**
2. Click **Delete** on any assistant
3. Confirm deletion
4. Check console logs:
   ```
   ✅ Should see:
   - "Starting assistant deletion for ID: xxx"
   - "Deleting user document: xxx"
   - "User document deleted successfully"
   - "Deleting assistant document: xxx"
   - "Assistant document deleted successfully"
   ```

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

---

### Test 2: Complete Deletion (with Firebase Auth)

**Prerequisites:** Firebase Admin SDK configured

1. Navigate to **Admin → Assistants**
2. Click **Delete** on any assistant
3. Confirm deletion
4. Check console logs:
   ```
   ✅ Should see:
   - "Starting assistant deletion for ID: xxx"
   - "Deleting user document: xxx"
   - "User document deleted successfully"
   - "Deleting authentication account..."
   - "Authentication account deleted successfully"
   - "Deleting assistant document: xxx"
   - "Assistant document deleted successfully"
   ```

5. Verify in Firebase Console:
   - Go to Authentication → Users
   - User should be removed from list

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail [ ] Skipped (No Admin SDK)

## 🔍 How It Works

### **Deletion Flow:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Admin clicks "Delete" on assistant                       │
└───────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
                        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 1: Get assistant document to find userId           │
└───────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
                        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 2: Delete user document from 'users' collection    │
│         (User profile removed from Firestore)            │
└───────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
                        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└───────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
                        ▼

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### **Scenario 1: Admin SDK Not Configured**
```
⚠️ Warning logged:
"Firebase Admin SDK not configured. User deleted from Firestore but not from Authentication."

Result: ✅ Assistant still deleted from Firestore
        ⚠️ Auth account remains
```

### **Scenario 2: User Already Deleted from Auth**
```
ℹ️ Info logged:
"User not found in Firebase Auth (might be already deleted)"

Result: ✅ Deletion continues successfully
```

### **Scenario 3: Network Error**
```
❌ Error logged:
"Error deleting auth user: [error details]"

Result: ✅ Assistant still deleted from Firestore
        ⚠️ Auth account remains
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Firebase Admin SDK not configured"

**Solutions:**
1. [ ] Install firebase-admin: `npm install firebase-admin`
2. [ ] Add credentials to `.env.local`
3. [ ] Restart dev server
4. [ ] Check environment variables are set correctly

---

### Problem: "Failed to delete user"

**Check:**
1. [ ] Service account has correct permissions
2. [ ] Private key is correctly formatted (with `\n`)
3. [ ] Project ID matches your Firebase project
4. [ ] Client email is from Firebase Admin SDK

---

### Problem: "Permission denied"

**Solutions:**
1. [ ] Ensure service account has "Firebase Authentication Admin" role
2. [ ] Regenerate service account key
3. [ ] Check Firestore security rules allow deletion

---

### Problem: Assistant deleted but auth account remains

**This is expected if:**
- Firebase Admin SDK not installed
- Credentials not configured
- Admin SDK initialization failed

**To verify:**
```bash
# Check if firebase-admin is installed
npm list firebase-admin

# Check if credentials are set
cat .env.local | grep FIREBASE_
```

---

## 📊 Current vs Previous Behavior

### **BEFORE:**
```
Delete Assistant
    ↓
❌ Only deleted assistant document
❌ User profile remained in Firestore
❌ Auth account remained active
❌ User could potentially still login
```

### **AFTER (Firestore Only):**
```
Delete Assistant
    ↓
✅ Deletes assistant document
✅ Deletes user profile from Firestore
⚠️ Auth account remains (but can't login without profile)
```

### **AFTER (Complete Setup):**
```
Delete Assistant
    ↓
✅ Deletes assistant document
✅ Deletes user profile from Firestore
✅ Deletes auth account from Firebase Authentication
✅ Complete cleanup - no traces left
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ Best Practices Implemented:

1. **Service Account Security**
   - Credentials stored in environment variables
   - Never committed to version control
   - Server-side only (not exposed to client)

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Works even if Admin SDK not configured
   - Continues deletion if auth deletion fails
   - Logs warnings instead of failing completely

3. **Error Handling**
   - Catches and logs all errors
   - Provides meaningful error messages
   - Doesn't break the application

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Console logs for every step
   - Tracks deletion progress
   - Easy to debug issues
