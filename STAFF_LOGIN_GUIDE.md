## Security & Authentication

### Authentication Flow:
1. User enters email/password
2. System checks if user exists in Firebase Auth
3. System fetches user profile from Firestore
4. System verifies user has valid role (admin/doctor/assistant)
5. User is granted access to admin portal

### Role Verification:
- Only users with roles: `admin`, `doctor`, or `assistant` can access the portal
- Other roles (like `patient`) are automatically redirected
- Invalid users are logged out immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"User is not authorized"**
- Check if user has correct role in Firestore
- Ensure role is one of: admin, doctor, assistant

**"User profile not found"**
- User exists in Firebase Auth but not in Firestore
- Create user profile in Firestore with correct role

**Login fails**
- Check email/password combination
- Ensure user account is active
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Getting Help:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify user exists in Firebase Auth
3. Verify user profile exists in Firestore with correct role
4. Try creating new test users using the Settings page

## Next Steps
